### Overview

This code for this project was created by Å½iga Trojer. Simple CNN architecture was used for ear recognition based on 1000 images of 100 different persons. We tackeled gender and ethnicity recognition.


### Dependencies

* Python 3.6
* Numpy
* TensorFlow 2.1.0
* Keras 2.3.1
* OpenCV

Exported environment: environment.yml

### Instructions

 * Install all dependencies from the `environment.yml` file (I did not use Jupyter Notebook due to issues with incompatibility of Tensorflow and Jupyter Notebook).
 * Put AWE dataset in `AWEForSegmentation` folder.
 * Run the `preprocess_data.py` to get cropped and resized images of ears and the right annotations. All processed pictures will be in a `train` and `test` folder, annotations fill be in a main folder.
 * Run `python train_model.py gender` for training the gender model or `python train_model.py ethnicity` for training ethnicity model.
    + Model for gender prediction is in `gender_model.py` and for ethnicity prediction is in `ethnicity_model.py`.
    + Metrics accuracy and confusion matrix are given.
 * For predicting, run `python predict.py gender 1` to predict gender on image `0001.png` in file `test_predict`, so make sure to put images in that file with the right names.

### Models

All models and results are saved in a `gender_models` and `ethnicity_models` file.
